				<p>
					I'm David, an Embedded C++ Software Engineer currently working on Autonomous Driving features for the BMW Group.  
					My main areas of interest are High Performance Computing, Embedded Systems, and Computer Graphics.
					During my Masters I specialized in concurrency and parallelism with a focus on GPU acceleration, but in my free 
					time I've also dabbled in other kinds of projects such as emulators, game engines, 3D Graphics, HDLs, etc.
					Here you'll find some of my main projects, research articles, and blog posts. The last sentence of this paragraph is
					just here so that the text nicely matches the height of the image (I'm not very good at front-end).
