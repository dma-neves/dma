        <p>
            In 2023, my grandfather Jacob Van Eck sadly passed away at the age of 90. Jaap Van Eck was not only a great loving grandfather, but also an
            atomic physicist with a fascinating career. After his passing, given my hobbyist interest in physics (and in his work), I was asked if I would 
            like to keep some of his research material, including pictures of his laboratory equipment, his farewell-lecture notes, and his PhD thesis.
            While going through these documents, I thought it would be nice to compile some of the most interesting and relevant information regarding his fascinating career
            into a blog post instead of just keeping it all dusting on a shelf.

            Since an early age, I have been curious about my grandfather's work. Whenever he would visit, he would share his passion for science with my brother and me, conducting 
            fun experiments and discussing topics ranging from the cosmos to the atomic realm. While I found these interactions fascinating, 
            I never fully grasped the specifics of his research. I knew it involved studying interactions at the atomic level and that he frequently 
            worked at particle colliders, but the details remained unclear. This blog post is also an attempt to gain a better understanding of his scientific 
            pursuits. I will go through some of Jaap's early life, his road to academia, and try to summarize some of the highlights of his career and research.
