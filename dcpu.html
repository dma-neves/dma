        <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>



        <p>
            Since a long time, I've found computers fascinating machines and wondered how they worked. My first attempts at understanding these 
            complicated systems arose during middle school while playing around with redstone circuitry in Minecraft.
            I wondered how one could go from basic digital circuits to executing complex programs as we are used to. But it's
            fair to say that the jump from some simulated wiring in a video game to a functional computer was a bit ambitious. Fast forward 
            to 2020, during my second year of University, and after learning about Digital Systems, Computer Architectures and Operating Systems, I 
            felt I finally had the necessary base knowledge to make the leap. With some basic knowledge of VHDL I decided to design and implement
            a simple ALU, and then went on from there.
        </p>
            In this guide, I will try to guide you through the steps I went through (excluding all the original trial and error) to
            build a primitive CPU in VHDL using logic gates as the foundational building blocks. Even though VHDL allows one to design and implement complex systems
            using high-level behavioral descriptions (that are then compiled down to logic gates), I tried to purposely avoid these high-level features (like processes)
            in order to achieve a deeper and more complete understanding of the inner workings of a CPU.
        <p>

        <p>
            It's important to note that the CPU we will be building is in no way revolutionary, impressive or particularly well designed. Hence the
            the name DCPU (Dumb CPU). Rather, the CPU is supposed to be as simple as possible, while still including most of the important functionalities
            a CPU needs to be usable.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Note:</b> The source code of this project can be found in my Github <a href="https://github.com/dma-neves/dcpu/">repository<a>. Also note that the original
                project is a 16 bit CPU, while the code I provide in this document follows mostly an 8 bit design for compactness.

        <p>
            Before diving into the implementation, we first need to establish some basic background information and concepts like the Von Nuemann Architecture,
            transistors, logic gates, Hardware Description Languages and FPGAs. If you are already familiar with these concepts, skip to the next chapter.

        <p>
            In 1945, John Von Neumann proposed an architecture for an electronic digital computer (Fig.2).
            This would end up becoming the basis for pretty much all computer architectures,
            even to this day. The architecture proposes a system with the following essential components:
            <ul>
                <li>A processing unit with an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) and registers. A register stores a value in a set of bits.</li>
                <li>A control unit including an instruction register and a program counter.</li>
                <li>A memory unit that stores data and instructions.</li>
                <li>Input and output mechanisms.</li>
            </ul>

            Our CPU will mostly follow this norm, with some small deviations. We will separate the memory unit in a read-only unit that stores instructions and 
            a read-write unit to store and manipulate data. This decision is a bit redundant, but makes our lives slightly easier. We will also mostly ignore IO.

        <p>
            Fundamentally, computers are made of billions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor">transistors</a>. These transistors are combined to form logic gates. With logic gates we can build any 
            digital system, including our CPU. A logic gate takes one or two bits as input and outputs a single bit. Fig.3 shows all the basic logic gates. AND outputs
            1 if both inputs are 1 otherwise 0, OR outputs 1 if any of the inputs is 1 and XOR outputs 1 if exactly one of the inputs is 1. The bottom three logic gates
            are the same as the first three but followed by a NOT logic gate. A NOT logic gates that takes a single input and outputs its negation. A circle succeeding a
            logic gate's symbol, indicates a negation.
            We can combine
            these logic gates to add two numbers represented in binary form, perform more complex arithmetic operations, store data and even implement a modern Intel or AMD CPU if we were clever enough.
        </p>

        <!-- <p>
            Given that computers are built entirely from logic gates that only operate over bits, all numbers (and values in general) must be represented in binary
            form. Just like we ususually represent numbers using combinations of 10 digits (0, 1, 2, ..., 9), in binary we represent numbers using combinations of just 2 digits (0 and 1).
            The numbers from 0 to 5 are represented in binary as follows: 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101. From here on out, whenever we want to express numbers written in base-2, we
            will use the prefix '0b' to easily differentiate from the base-10 notation. For example the previous numbers from 0 to 5 can be expressed as follows:
            0b0, 0b1, 0b10, 0b11, 0b100, 0b101.
        </p> -->

        <p>
             In order to develop our own CPU, we need to somehow create or represent a circuit composed of these logic gates. One way would be to buy some chips with
             logic gates and assemble them on a breadboard. Another option would be to design an manufacture an actual microchip. Given that both these
             options don't scale very well, can cost some money and aren't very debug friendly, a more convenient and cheaper alternative is to design our circuits
             using a hardware description language like VHDL. These languages allow one to describe a digital system using code. With the VHDL code we can then simulate
             the circuit on our computer, or "upload" it to an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array). An FPGA is an integrated circuit that can be configured to behave
             as "any" circuit we want. 
        </p>
            Note that this guide will not include an in depth tutorial on VHDL, so even though the VHDL we'll be writing 
            is very basic, you might want to watch some basic VHDL tutorial first. I will also assume that you have some basic knowledge of programming and concepts
            like <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure/">stacks</a>,

            and <a href="https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/">GTKWave</a>

            Our first step is to build an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit). This unit is responsible for carrying out all the math operations a CPU might need to perform. 
            A simple ALU (Fig.4), takes as inputs two binary numbers (operands) and an operation code (opcode), and outputs a binary number (result) and some flags (status) that correspond to the
            result of performing the specified operation on the operands.

            The first operation we'll implement is addition. If we want to add two bits <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, we can use the circuit seen in Fig.5, a half-adder. The AND gate
            computes the carry bit and the XOR gate the result bit. If <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are 1 then the result is 0 and the carry is 1. If <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are 0 then the result is 0 and the carry is 0.
            If only A or only B is 1, the result is 1 and the carry 0. To make a full-adder (Fig.6) that takes as input two bits <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, and a carry bit <code>Cin</code>, we simply chain two
            half-adders and OR the carry bits. We can implement this circuit in VHDL as follows:

        result : OUT STD_LOGIC;
        carryOut : OUT STD_LOGIC

    end FullAdder;

            To make an adder that adds two numbers <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> of <math>N</math> bits, we can use <math>N</math> full-adders. We add the first bits from <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> using 
            the first full-adder, passing 0 as the carry in, then add the second bits from A and B using the second full-adder, routing the carry out from the first full-adder to
            the carry in from the second full-adder, and so on. The following code implements an 8 bit adder:

            The next challenge is dealing with subtractions and negative numbers. The most popular approach to this problem
            is using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement">two's compliment</a> method. We assume that the the binary digit with the 
            greatest place value (the left most) in a binary number represents the number's sign. 0 corresponds
            to a positive number and 1 corresponds to a negative number. Positive numbers are represented in the same way as before, while negative numbers 
            are encoded differently. To represent a negative number in two's compliment, we use the following method:
            <ul>
                <li>Starting with the equivalent positive number.</li>
                <li>Invert (or flip) all bits.</li>
                <li>Add 1 to the entire inverted number, ignoring any overflow</li>
            </ul>
            This encoding might seem a bit odd, but it actually takes advantage of some nice properties. Namely, adding two numbers in this representation works perfectly
            with both negative and positive numbers. For example adding <code>4</code> (<code>0b00000100</code>) to <code>-3</code> (<code>0b11111101</code>), this is <code>4-3</code>, gives us <code>0b11111111</code>, which encodes the value <code>-1</code>.
            By adding a module to our ALU that negates a value, we can then implement subtractions by performing negations followed by additions. This is, <code>A-B</code>
            can be implemented as <code>A+(-B)</code>. A negation module can be implement as follows using the previous adder and an 8 bit NOT operator:

            The final piece we need to build the ALU is a multiplexer, which given a set of input values, allows us to select a specific one. 
            Assuming a multiplexer receives a set of inputs <code>I0, I1, ..., IN</code>
            (each input can be a single bit or a binary value) and a selector <code>S</code>, it outputs the value <code>In</code>, where <code>n</code> is the index selected by <code>S</code>. This is,
            if <code>S</code> is <code>0b0</code> the output is <code>I0</code>, if <code>S</code> is <code>0b1</code> the output is <code>I1</code>, if <code>S</code> is <code>0b10</code> the output is <code>I2</code> and so on. Such a component can be easily implemented
            using AND gates connecting each input <code>I</code> with the necessary <code>S</code> value (NOT gates used for the bits that should be zero) and a final OR gate
            combining all the intermediate outputs. Fig.7 shows a multiplexer circuit with 4 input values and a two bit selector S. This multiplexer can be implemented as follows:

            operations. Our opcode will therefore be specified by a 3 bit value (since <code>2^3 = 8</code>). Tab.1 shows the 8 operations we will support.

            Fig.8 shows a diagram of the ALU that implements these 8 operations. It receives two 8 bit input operands <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> as well as an input opcode. For
            output, we have a single 8 bit result and three flags: overflow, negative and zero.
            The ALU contains the Adder, Negate, NOT, OR and AND components we
            discussed earlier, a set of multiplexers and some auxiliary gates. The first operand of the Adder is always <code>A</code>, while the second is selected by a multiplexer
            that can either select <code>B</code> (add), <code>1</code> (inc), <code>-1</code> (dec) or the result of the Negate component (sub). The Negate input is selected by a multiplexer that can either
            select <code>A</code> (neg) or <code>B</code> (sub). All the other components simply operate over <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> (operations: not, and, or). The final result is selected by a multiplexer
            that can either select the Negate output (neg), the NOT output (not), the AND output (and), the OR output (or) or the Adder output (operations: add, inc, dec, sub).
            The overflow flag can be set either by the Adder component or the Negate component, and the negative and zero flag simply check if the result is negative or
            zero.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>Notes:</b> In this circuit there are actually two adders given that there is
            also an adder embedded in the Negate module. We could refine the design and share a single Adder for both purposes, but this solution
            is slightly more convenient and allows us to implement the subtraction operation easily. Note also that the negation performed on the selector of Mux5
            is somewhat unnecessary. It is present in this schematic just to achieve a more convenient layout of the inputs.

        <p>
            With the ALU built, we can now perform "all" the mathematical operations we need. However, we need some way to store the results of these operations and data in general. 
            Fortunately, some smart physicists in the early 20th century found a way to store information using circuits, called multi-vibrators, that can easily be reproduced 
            using transistor-based logic gates. Fig.9 shows the schematic of a SR Flip-Flop. A SR Flip-Flop stores a state <code>Q</code> (note: <code>Q' = ~Q</code>) and provides two inputs
            to set the state (<code>Q = 1</code>) and reset the state (<code>Q = 0</code>). Considering that the Flip-Flop is in the current state <code>Qn</code>, Tab.2 presents its truth table. Given that the
            NOR gate's output is only 1 when both outputs are 0, we can see that if <code>Q</code> is 1 and <code>Q'</code> is 0, setting <code>S</code> to 1 results in <code>Q</code> changing to 0 and therefore <code>Q'</code> to 1. While 
            setting <code>R</code> to 0 results in <code>Q'</code> changing to 1 and therefore <code>Q</code> to 0. If this doesn't seem clear, Ben Eater has a great comprehensive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM0DdEaY5sY&t=241s">video</a> 
            on this circuit alone.

        <p>
            Given that computer programs must perform a sequence of instructions, and not just a single operation, CPUs need some sort of sequencing mechanism.
            This is where the clock comes in. Inside every computer is a clock generator, usually a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_oscillator">crystal oscillator</a>, that generates a pulse (or voltage)
            at even intervals as seen in Fig.10. The CPU can then use this clock to perform an instruction step on each clock cycle (More information on this in chapter 6). This means that
            state changes inside a CPU must also occur synchronously with the clock. Ideally, the state of a Flip-Flop inside a CPU, should only be updated during a clock pulse
            (a change of signal from 0 to 1, or from 1 to 0) to eliminate any glitches related to signal propagation delays and to ensure state changes happen in sync with
            the rest of the CPU.

            Fig.11 shows the schematic for a D Flip-Flop. This Flip-Flop is similar to the
            previous one, but receives an enable signal as input, which can be connected to the clock signal (or connected to an AND gate with the clock signal) to ensure that any state changes issued to the Flip-Flop 
            are only triggered during a clock pulse*. It also combines the previous S and R inputs into
            a single Data input. Tab.3 presents the D Enable Flip-Flop's truth table. 
            <!-- Considering the enable input is connected to an AND gate with a clock signal, it can be used as follows: 
            the Flip-Flop initially stores some state and is disabled. Whenever we want to update its state,
            we enable it and feed it the new data/state we want it to store. Then during the clock pulse* the update is triggered, and finally we disable it again.
         -->
        </p>

        <p>
            Note the asteriscs I added when mentioning the clock pulse in the previous paragraph. This circuit does not in fact trigger the update during a clock pulse, but rather, allows updates
            whenever the clock is set to 1. We can refine the Flip-Flop to only trigger during a clock pulse by utilizing a master-slave Flip-Flop system. We won't get into details
            on how a master-slave Flip-Flop works, but it basically involves chaining two Flip-Flops and using the first's input as the second's enable input. Ben Eater has a great 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXHSB5w7CyE&t=380s">video</a>
            going through a master-slave JK Flip-Flop if you're interested (and also a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1OC5e7Tn_o">video</a> on JK Flip-Flops).
            Given that implementing one of these Flip-Flops manually (using logic) in VHDL can be prone to latching bugs, we will make an exception, and implement the D 
            Flip-Flop using a VHDL process. This Flip-Flop includes a reset input which just sets the input to zero, and an enable input which sets Q to the
            input data D whenever there is a pulse from 0 to 1:

            A memory module can be implemented as a large array of registers. In a memory module, each register must be accessible by an address.
            The first register can be set to address <code>0b00000000</code>, the second register to address <code>0b00000001</code> and so on. This addressing system can be
            achieved by connecting the registers to a large demultiplexer. A demultiplexer implements the inverse operation of a multiplexer. With a
            selector (the address), the demultiplexer routs an input value to one of the <math>N</math> outputs (<math>N</math> registers for example). Note that there are more efficient ways 
            (using less logic gates) of implementing a memory module. Since the focus of this project is the implementation of a CPU, and not necessarily memory
            modules, I implemented the

        <p>
            Now that we are able to perform operations and store and manipulate state, its time to define our CPU's architecture as well as its
            ISA (Instruction Set Architecture). A CPU's ISA, is simply the set of instructions it supports. As we discussed in chapter 1, following
            the Von Neumann architecture, our system should include an ALU, a memory module, a set of registers and a control unit. Fig.12 shows the
            schematic of the system we aim to build. It contains a control unit, two memory modules (a ROM to store a program and a RAM to store data),
            the ALU we implemented previously, a set of registers, and a set of multiplexers and <a href="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/combination/comb_3.html">demultiplexers</a> (inverse multiplexer).
            
            In terms of registers, the CPU will have 8 general purpose registers (RA, RB, ..., RH), used to store temporary values during a program's execution, and 7
            specialized registers:

            <ul>
                <li><b>IC:</b> Instruction Counter saves the address of the current instruction being executed.</li>
                <li><b>IR:</b> Instruction Restister saves the instruction (the opcode) being executed.</li>
                <li><b>IDR:</b>Instruction Data Register saves the data associated to the instruction being executed (more on this on chapter 6).</li>
                <li><b>ADR:</b>Address Register saves an address that can be used to address the memory modules or to jump to the specified address/instruction.</li>
                <li><b>IACR:</b>Instruction Accumulator Register saves the result of the ALU from an operation triggered by the instruction being executed.</li>
                <li><b>PACR:</b>Program Accumulator Register saves the result of the ALU during a program counter increment (more on this on chapter 6).</li>
                <li><b>FLAGR:</b>Flag Register saves the values of the flag values from the ALU.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            With this architecture in mind, we can now define an ISA. For our CPU to be usable it needs to be at the very least Turing complete.
            Turing completeness refers to a system's ability to perform any computation that a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Turing machine</a>,
            allowing it to perform virtually any computation. In practice this requires our ISA to support conditional branches, some iteration mechanism and memory
            manipulation. We can achieve this by combining our ALU operations with some load and move operations to move data between registers and memory, a jump 
            operation (jump to a specific instruction or address) and some conditional jump operations. 
        </p>
            
        <p>
            Additionally, as programs get more complex, having a stack becomes
            pretty essential, and for this reason, we will also include some basic support for a stack. Register RH will be used as the stack pointer, and we'll include
            an operation to subtract a value directly from it (useful when addressing variables stored in the stack). A stack also allows us to support functions as we
            can push both parameters and return addresses to the stack. The ADR register allows us to move said return addresses to it, and then perform the corresponding 
            jump to the return address.
            
        </p>
            
        <p>
            Finally, some instructions require some data to
            be specified alongside the instruction. For example to subtract a value from the stack pointer, we need to pass a value alongside the instruction.
            We could reserve some of the instruction bits for data, but for convenience we will pass this data separately.
            This is not very efficient, since in the ROM module (that stores the program), instead of storing each instruction in a single address line, we will require 2
            address lines, one for the instruction and one for the instruction data. We could improve this, but for the sake of simplicity we will trade some memory efficiency for
            a simpler design. The ISA we will use for our CPU is the following (considering an 8-bit architecture):

        <p>
            The last piece of the puzzle is the Control Unit which orchestrates all the other components of the CPU taking into account the previous ISA. It takes
            a clock signal as input and performs an instruction step on each clock cycle. An instruction can usually be split into three
            logical steps: fetch (get the instruction from memory), decode (decode the instruction) and execute (trigger the inputs of the
            other components of the CPU). In our CPU, each instruction will be composed of 7 steps (we have some extra steps given that we separated the instructions
            from the instructions' data):

            <ol>
                <li><b>Fetch instruction:</b> Fetch the instruction stored in the memory address <code>[IC]</code> in the ROM module to the IR register.</li>
                <li><b>Increment IC:</b> Increment the value stored in the register IC using the ALU.</li>
                <li><b>Load increment:</b> Load the value of the previous increment, that is stored int the IACR register, to the IC register.</li>
                <li><b>Fetch instruction data:</b> Fetch the instruction data stored in the memory address <code>[IC]</code> in the ROM module to the IDR register.</li>
                <li><b>Decode and execute:</b> Decode the instruction and execute it by triggering the inputs of the required components.</li>
                <li><b>Increment IC:</b> Same as 2.</li>
                <li><b>Load increment:</b> Same as 3.</li>
            </ol>

            </figure>

            To perform these steps, the control unit needs a seven-state state machine that loops indefinitely (until the hlt instruction is executed). 
            A state machine can easily implemented using D Flip-Flops. In this case using 7 D Flip-Flops, and 1 D Flip-Flop that resets to 1 instead of 0.
            Fig.14 shows the schematic for this state machine. Initially the state machine is reset, which results in all Flip-Flops to be set to 0
            except the yellow one which is reset to 1. In the next clock cycle the yellow Flip-Flop is set to 0 given its input data is 0. The first
            green Flip-Flop is set to 1 given that the previous state of the yellow Flip-Flop, which is connected to the green Flip-Flop's input data, was 1.
            In the second clock cycle, the second green Flip-Flop's state changes to 1 and the first goes back to 0, this cycle continues until the
            seventh state, at which point its output loops back to the first green Flip-Flop's input data. We can implement this circuit in VHDL as follows:

        <p>
            With the state machine built, we can now build our control unit to operate based on the output of the state machine's state.
            Fig.13 shows the control unit we'll build. As you can see it is composed of four main components: 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The state machine we just built to differentiate each instruction step.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The instruction decoder which is just a demultiplexer using the opcode as the input selector and
                    outputting a bit per instruction (the bit corresponding to the decoded instruction is set to 1 and the rest to 0).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The operation decoder which
                    receives as input the decoded instruction and relevant flags, and outputs the operations that need to be preformed on the CPU like enabling a register, selecting
                    a specific input from a multiplexer, selecting a specific output from a demultiplexer, enable writes to the RAM module, or selecting a operation
                    to perform on the ALU.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finally, the select and synchronize operations isn't actually a component, but rather a logical aggregation of operations that are performed
                    directly in the control unit module. This "module" triggers the necessary operations for all the instruction steps that aren't the decode and
                    execute step. When the state machine is in the decode and execute step, the operations outputted by the operation decoder are triggered. Also, all the
                    register enable operations are ANDed to the clock signal, as described in chapter 4, to ensure the state of the registers is only updated during
                    clock pulses. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            As already stated, the instruction decoder is just a glorified demultiplexer so we'll skip its VHDL implementation. We'll now go through the
            implementation of the operation decoder. The module has as output, all the possible operations that can be performed on the various components
            of the CPU, this is, all of the inputs of these components. We therefore need to first figure out, which operations (or component inputs) we
            want to trigger in each CPU instruction. Lets start with the first instruction: <code class="language-vhdl">add RX RY</code>. In order to perform this instruction
            we need to set the ALU's first operand to RX and the second operand to RY, set the ALU's opcode to the <code class="language-vhdl">add</code> operation and finally,
            enable the accumulator register (PACR). We can achieve this by triggering the following operations:
            <ul>
                <li>Set the ALU's operand A selector to <code>0b0</code> (so that the routed input is RX).</li>
                <li>Set the ALU's operand B selector to <code>0b0</code> (so that the routed input is RY).</li>
                <li>Set the ALU's opcode to <code>0b000</code> (add opcode).</li>
                <li>Set the PACR enable to 1 (save the result of the addition).</li>
            </ul>

            Or in terms of setting inputs to 1, we simply need to set PACR_En to 1. The idea is that we now do this for each instruction. This is of course quite time consuming,
            but thankfully, I've already done this boring job in the past, and the complete list of the required operations for each instruction can be found 
            <a href="https://github.com/dma-neves/dcpu/blob/main/other/instruction_outputs/instructionOutputs.txt">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            After knowing all the relationships between each instruction, and the low-level operations that need to be triggered to preform the instruction, we can
            implement the operation decoder module by defining each operation/output as the OR between all the instructions that require that operation/output to be set to 1. 
            
            Note that some instructions also take into account flags to trigger (or not) certain operations, like for example the instruction <code class="language-vhdl">jmpz</code>, which
            is only performed if the zero flag is set.
        </p>

        
        <p>
            To make our lives easier, I developed a small 
            <a href="https://github.com/dma-neves/dcpu/blob/main/other/instruction_outputs/instOutputsToVHDL.py">python script </a>
            that takes as input the 
            <a href="https://github.com/dma-neves/dcpu/blob/main/other/instruction_outputs/instructionOutputs.txt">list</a> we saw previously,
            and outputs the body of the corresponding module. 

        </p>

        <p>
            Although this script handles most of the modules body, we still have to take into account some important details that will be programmed manually.

            Namely, many of our instructions operate over general purpose registers RX and RY. The indices X and Y are both passed in the instruction data.
            Index X is stored in the first 4 bits (or 8 bits in case of a 16 bit architecture) of the instruction data and index Y in the last 4 bits (or 8 bits).
            The 8 registers are aggregated into a single block like we can see in Fig.12. We use a demultiplexer when we want to update the state of a specific register, 
            and two multiplexer to route the value of specific registers to the rest of the CPU. The first operation (update the state of a register) is always performed
            on index X (since load instructions are always performed over RX). This means that the selector of the multiplexer is simply directly wired to the first 4 bits of 
            the IDR (Instruction Data Register).
            For the second operation (routing the output of a register to the rest of the CPU) we need to consider routing both the RX and RY registers to deal
            with instructions that operate over two operands, like <code class="language-vhdl">add RX RY</code>. This means that the selector of the multiplexer on the left is wired to the
            first 4 bits of the IDR, and the multiplexer on the right is wired to the last 4 bits of the IDR.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, also note that the flag register enable can be wired to the same signal as the PACR register enable, given that
            whenever we store the the ALU's result in the PACR register we also of course want to update the flag register. 
        </p>

        <p>

        <p>
            As we discussed previously, the select and synchronize operations "module" is just a logical aggregation of operations that are performed
            directly in the control unit module. Given that some of the instruction steps, like Increment IC and Load Increment, also need to trigger operations
            like the instructions during the Decode and Execute step, a bunch of OR and AND gates are used to select the necessary operations depending on the
            current state of the state-machine and the operations selected by the operation decoder. All the enable operations are also ANDed to the clock signal
            as already stated.
        </p>

            <img src="resources/dcpu/clock_state_changes.svg" width="350">
            <figcaption>Fig.15 Clock signal and state changes</figcaption>
        </figure>
        </center>

        <p>
            One important detail is that the register enable operations are actually ANDed to the inverted clock signal (clock signal followed by a NOT gate) instead of the raw clock signal. 
            This results in the registers being updated on the down pulses (clock change from 1 to 0). Fig.15 shows why this is important. The state-machine state changes are triggered 
            during the up clock pulses (clock change from 0 to 1), meaning that the instruction decoding and/or operation selection, for a given instruction, starts right after such a pulse.
            If we were to update the registers during the up clock pulses as well, we would get signal propagation delay related glitches. We would update the registers before the correct input
            data would reach the registers. To ensure this doesn't happen, the registers are updated on the down clock pulses, right at the middle point of a clock cycle.    
        </p>

        <p>
            The VHDL code for the control unit is quite long, so I won't include it in this document, but it can be found <a href="https://github.com/dma-neves/dcpu/blob/main/src/CU/ControlUnit.vhd">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, with the control unit built, the full CPU module can easily be implemented by wiring all the components we have just built as seen in Fig.12.
            Since the code for the module is quite extensive and not particularly interesting, I also won't include it in this document, but it can be found
            <a href="https://github.com/dma-neves/dcpu/blob/main/src/Main/CPU.vhd">here</a>,
            and this is what the entity's port looks like:
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code class="language-vhdl">
    entity CPU is
    Port(
        reset : in STD_LOGIC;
        clk : in STD_LOGIC;
        dataIn : in STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(7 downto 0);
    
        address : out STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(7 downto 0);
        dataOut : out STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(7 downto 0);
        readWrite : out STD_LOGIC;
        fetch : out STD_LOGIC; 
    );
    end CPU;
            </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            Similarly, the main module also just involves wiring the CPU module with the memory modules.

            To switch between the RAM and ROM modules, a the fetch signal (controlled by the control unit) is used to enable and disable the two memory modules. Whenever fetch is set to 1, to ROM
            module is enabled and the RAM disabled, and vice-versa. The fetch signal is only set to zero during the Decode and Execute step.
        </p>

        <h2 id="firstprogram">7. Executing a Program</h2>

        <p>
            With the CPU built, its time to write and execute our first program. Given that our program will reside in the ROM, at this point, writing and loading a 
            program into our CPU, is achieved by manually writing the instructions in binary in the correct address lines. To start simple, we'll write a program that
            multiplies two numbers (given that our ALU doesn't directly support multiplication). In C we could easily implement a multiplication program using only
            addition and looping as follows:
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code class="language-c">
    int a = 3;
    int b = 5;
    int res = 0;

    for(int i = 0; i < b; i++) {

        res += a;
    }
            </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            In our CPU, we can assume that register RA, RB, RC and RD hold the variables a, b, res and i respectively. The loop can then be implemented using
            a set of additions and some conditional jumps. Here is the assembly code that expresses the previous program:
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code class="language-arm-asm">
    ; a = 3
    lod $3 RA

    ; b = 5
    lod $5 RB

    ; res = 0
    lod $0 RC

    ; i = 0
    lod $0 RD

    loop_start:

        ; res += a
        add RC RA
        lod ACR RC

        ; i++
        inc RD
        lod ACR RD

        ; if i < b goto loop_start
        sub RD RB
        jmpn loop_start

    hlt
            </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            Note that loading a specific value to a specific register (<code>lod $V RX</code>) is actually achieved using two instructions instead of the single
            instruction like we used in the previous code. This operation can be performed as follows
            (assuming ADR is set to an unused address like <code>0x3e</code>):
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code class="language-arm-asm">
    str $V [ADR]
    lod [ADR] RX
            </code>
        </pre>             
            Finally we have to translate this assembly, into machine code:

            Finally, we can write a simple 
            <a href="https://github.com/dma-neves/dcpu/blob/main/src/tests/main_test.vhd">VHDL test</a> for our Main module, 
            simulate it using ghdl, and view the simulation using GTKWave. As you can see
            in Fig.16 the final result stored in register RC (representing our variable res) is 15! The result of 3*5.

        <h2 id="assembler">8. Assembler</h2>

        <p>
            As you may have noticed, translating assembly into machine code is quite time consuming and tedious. This is where an assembler
            comes in handy. I've implemented a simpler 
            <a href="https://github.com/dma-neves/dcpuAssembler/">assembler</a> 
            for our ISA in python. I won't give a detailed guide on how to implement
            such an assembler given that this could become a whole new guide of its own. Another reason, is that the assembler I've
            implemented is of relatively low quality as it doesn't really follow the usual structure of a compiler/assembler 
            (lexer, parser, code generator, etc), rather, it just uses a bunch of string manipulations directly. However, it gets the job done.
            I also included a ROM generator which turns the outputed machine code from the assembler into a VHDL ROM module which we
            can load into our VHDL project.
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            To make our lives easier, we can also add a set of macros to the assembler to avoid rewriting repetitive code patterns. A macro,
            is a "fake" instruction, which is expanded into a set o multiple instructions of our ISA during assembly. For example, in chapter 7
            we saw it would be useful to have a <code class="language-vhdl">lod $V RX</code> instruction, which can be achieved by executing two existing instructions.
            Our assembler includes the following macros:
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code class="language-arm-asm">
    lod $V RX (load value to register):
        lod $62 ADR
        str $V [ADR]
        lod [ADR] RX
    
    psh ($V or RX) (push value or register to the top of the stack):
        lod SP ADR
        str ($V or RX) [ADR]
        inc SP
        lod ACR SP 
    
    pop RX (pop top of stack to RX):
        dec SP
        lod ACR SP
        lod SP ADR
        lod [ADR] RX
    
    pop (pop top of stack):
        dec SP
        lod ACR SP
    
    lsr $V RX (Load Stack variable V to Register RX):
        sub SP $V
        lod ACR ADR
        lod [ADR] RX
    
    srs RX $V (Store Register RX to Stack variable V):
        sub SP $V
        lod ACR ADR
        str RX [ADR]
            </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            With these macros and the assembler working, we can more easily test more complex programs. In the following program
            we define an average function, which given an array and its length, calculates its average (note: <code class="language-vhdl">;</code> initiates a line comment):
        </p>

        <pre>

            After assembling the program into machine code and generating the ROM module, we can simulate the CPU once again in ghdl, and view
            the result of the simulation using GTKWave. As seen in Fig.17, the result stored in register RA is 5 which is indeed 
            the average of the input array <code class="language-vhdl">arr = [5, 2, 9]</code>.

        <h2 id="fpga">9. FPGA</h2>

        <p>
            Once I was able to implement and execute "complex" programs on the DCPU, I decided to buy a cheap FPGA (the ALTERA CycloneII EP2C5T144)
            and load it on real Hardware as seen in Fig.18. This required some additional coding and configuration, namely:
            <ul>
                <li>Adding more outputs to some of the modules to have them accessible to the GPIO pins of the board.</li>
                <li>Adding modules to switch between various outputed registers.</li>
                <li>Adding modules to deal with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch#Contact_bounce">contact debounce</a> on switches.</li>
                <li>Configuring the board using Intel Quartus II Web Edition.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            This step is of course not very crucial for this project, but is quite fun since you are able to view and interact with the CPU in real time.
            It also allows us to later connect our CPU to other hardware and start thinking about IO. If you are interested in this particular board, I recommend
            the following this
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le6Jo5DpLao">video</a> 
            which gives a great introduction on the process of configuring it using Quartus II.
